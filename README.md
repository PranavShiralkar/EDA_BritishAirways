# ✈️ British Airways Data Science Project

## 📚 Background Information

### 📌 Task 1: Customer Feedback Analysis
British Airways (BA) operates thousands of flights daily across the world. Understanding customer feedback is crucial to improving service quality. This task focuses on **scraping and analyzing customer reviews** to extract insights and enhance customer satisfaction.

### 📌 Task 2: Customer Booking Prediction Model
In a competitive airline market, predicting customer behavior is essential. This task involves building a **predictive model** using booking data to identify whether a customer will purchase a holiday, helping BA make data-driven decisions.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Task 1 Dataset (Customer Feedback)**
    - **Source:** Web-scraped from [airlinequality.com](https://www.airlinequality.com/)
    - **Key Columns:**
      - `reviews`: Raw customer reviews
      - `Cleaned Reviews`: Processed text
      - `Sentiment`: Sentiment score (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

- **Task 2 Dataset (Customer Booking Data)**
    - **Source:** Customer booking records
    - **Goal:** Predict holiday purchase (Yes/No)

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Customer Feedback Analysis
1. **Data Collection:** Web scraping with BeautifulSoup.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removing noise, tokenization, and stopword removal.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Using **VADER** to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral.
4. **Visualization:** Pie charts for sentiment distribution and word clouds for common terms.

### Task 2: Customer Booking Prediction Model
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Building:** Training models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
3. **Evaluation:** Measuring performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📈 Results and Insights

### Task 1: Sentiment Analysis
- **Positive:** 45.8% of reviews
- **Negative:** 42.8% of reviews
- **Neutral:** 11.4% of reviews

**Insights:**
- Negative reviews often mention delays and poor service.
- Positive reviews highlight premium class comfort.

### Task 2: Predictive Model
- **Model Accuracy:** 87%
- **Key Predictors:** Age, location, booking lead time, and travel class.
